# Fraud Detection: E-commerce & Banking Transactions

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project builds **machine learning models to detect fraudulent e-commerce and banking transactions** using structured transaction data. It tackles key challenges such as **class imbalance**, **real-time prediction**, and **model interpretability**.

Developed as part of the [10 Academy](https://10academy.org/) AI Mastery program (Week 8&9) under the guidance of Adey Innovations Inc.
